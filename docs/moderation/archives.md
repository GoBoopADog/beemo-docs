## Making Archives 
There are currently a few ways that archives are generated with Beemo.

### Manually Generated
To manually generate an archive for a user, you must be a moderator and run `/archive [user]`.

### Automatically Generated
Whenever a moderative command is ran targetting a user, eg. ban, all of the users messages (including edits and deletions) will be archived and attached to the case.
